# <a id="_a9s6nipr10du"></a>Deadlines:

1. Submission deadline: Friday, Dec\. 9, 5:00 pm\. Submission closes on Mon\. Dec 12, 5pm\.
2. Demonstration deadline: Friday, Dec 16, 4pm\.

# <a id="_9l32ys4sz8l2"></a>Evaluation

1. Marks are awarded for evidence of credible actions to finish by the due date\. Such actions are measured by functionality completed each week \(as indicated by Git commits\) as well as submission by due date\. 
2. You may work in groups of up to 3\. Same requirements and rubric will apply to all teams regardless of team size\. Each team member must maintain their own repository and code must be contributed using ‚Äúpull requests‚Äù\. Individual contributions will be evaluated by the content of these pull requests\.
3. Late submission penalties TBD\.
4. Demonstrations must be completed before the demo deadline\.
5. A test plan with detailed tests will be provided\. Any test item that is checked must pass the test without any conditions\. During the demonstration, you may request part marks by providing a written request that states what test items fail and the impact that will have on the functionality of that item\. E\.g\. If test items 3\.f\.i, 3\.f\.ii and 3\.f\.iv passes, but 3\.f\.iii fails, what impact would that have on functionality of 3\.f?

Penalties will apply for not following the naming convention or any of the submission steps

# <a id="_5ujhxk18xv90"></a>Description

Develop an enhanced version of the web application developed in lab 3\. Additional features include the ability to create an account, save and edit play\-lists for logged in users, ability to make these play\-lists publicly accessible as well as the ability to add comments/ratings to individual tracks as well as to the play\-list, admin functionality to manage accounts and copyright related tasks\.

Use of Node\.js and a front\-end framework \(see list below\) is required\. Other technologies may include Mongodb and Express or any alternatives that suit you better\.

In case of any ambiguities, conflicting or unclear requirements, you are free to make a choice that is \(a\) sensible from a UI/UX point of view, \(b\) minimises your effort and \(c\) in keeping with the spirit of the application\. It is strongly advised to discuss such assumptions on the ‚ÄúLabs‚Äù channel on Teams if you are not sure\. You are also required to document all such decisions using git comments\.

This document may be revised to improve readability or to remove ambiguous, conflicting or unclear requirements\. Please pay attention to the revision statement at the top of this document\.

# <a id="_23lcnxh6cdzk"></a>Design Tip

Keep the number balls you juggle at one time to about 5 so that you are not overwhelmed by the complexity\. E\.g\. Keep the number of objects/concepts/modules that you have to grapple at one time to 5\. At the highest level, you may want to imagine about 5 components that make up the full application\. If these components as well as interactions among them work as intended, then your application should work as intended\. You may call that the architecture of your application\. Then think about the design of each component and apply the same principle\. 

Complexity of an application is not just the number of components, but also the number of interactions between these components\. A system with 5 components where each component interacts with every other component  is more complex than a system with 10 components where each component only interacts with two other components although they both have the same number of interactions\.

# <a id="_d1ndexlqwtft"></a>Resources

1. Allowed front\-end frameworks are: Angular, React\.
2. Firebase is a good option which provides authentication and database: [https://firebase\.google\.com](https://firebase.google.com)\. Firebase UI, SDK or equivalent library/framework is acceptable for implementing a login mechanism\. Note: Firebase should only be used to provide data storage and/or authentication services\. All other back\-end functionality must be implemented on your own server\.
3. JWT is the required method for implementing authorization and protected routes:
	1. Main site: [https://jwt\.io](https://jwt.io) 
	2. Good tutorial: [https://github\.com/dwyl/learn\-json\-web\-tokens](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens)
4. Copyright enforcement functionality: See slides 16\-19 of ‚Äúsocial issues‚Äù unit\.
5. Making pull requests on Github: [Creating a pull request \- Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

# <a id="_f7dqx7oady5m"></a>FAQ

1. You will need a developer account for third\-party authentication\. Only one external provider is needed\.  
2. Questions about item 6 \(copyright enforcement\): Please look at the test plan\. You may devise and implement any mechanism to satisfy the tests\. As long as it is part of the application and satisfies the test, it will be accepted\. No automation is needed\. E\.g\. Assume that the site administrator may receive copyright/abuse claims via email\. The administrator only needs to be able to log such requests via the application\.
3. Email verification \(2\.d\) requires the ability to send emails out, which is getting harder due to stricter anti\-spam controls implemented by major service providers\. Because of this, you may implement a mock\-up of the verification step as follows: 
	1. User enters an email address to create a new account\.
	2. An email is crafted that includes a unique link \(eg\. generated from a hash of user information\) that the user is required to click in order to verify the email address\.
	3. Instead of sending this email to the address that the user provided, it is shown on the client\.
	4. When a user visits the unique link \(click or copy\+paste to another browser window\), the address is verified\.
4. Soft\-matching strings using the Dice coefficient: [https://www\.npmjs\.com/package/string\-similarity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity)
5. You may use any database\.
6. You may redesign the back\-end API as necessary\. 
7. A mechanism to register users is required\. See 2\.a in requirements\.

# <a id="_5erk24s40bu"></a>Suggested Workflow

Following is a suggested workflow to plan the implementation of this lab\. Some design suggestions are provided only for information and you are not required to follow them\.

1. Read the Requirements section several times until you develop a mental picture of what the application does\.
2. Design a Database structure for the selected database\.
3. Revise the API designed in lab 3 to provide basic functionality\. It is a good idea to designate separate API prefixes for non\-authenticated, regular user and admin categories\. E\.g\. All paths in ‚Äú/api/secure/‚Äù require authentication as a regular user\. Paths in ‚Äú/api/admin/‚Äù require admin privileges\. Paths in ‚Äú/api/open/‚Äù do not require authentication\.
4. Review steps 1\-3 and re\-examine each design decision to verify that it provides the foundation for your current understanding of the requirements\.
5. Implement access control logic first for /api/secure and /api/admin\. 
	1. Implement all the routes first\. Don‚Äôt need to implement actual functionality\. E\.g\. log message on console to verify that it receives the request\.
	2. Implement access control for one route in /api/secure\. Each request must present a JWT and this token must be verified by the back\-end functionality\. See slides for ‚Äúrouter\.use\(\)‚Äù for implementing such common functionality\. 
	3. You may start with a pre\-generated JWT and use a ReST client \(E\.g\. Insomnia\) to test the functionality\.
	4. Implement access control in all remaining routes and ensure that code for access control is not duplicated\.
6. Implement back\-end functionality for a particular feature or a group of connected features and test it with a ReST client\. 
7. Implement front\-end Angular components that use the back\-end functionality developed above\.
8. Keep dependencies between modules to a simple tree\-like structure\.
